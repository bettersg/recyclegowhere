# recyclegowheredata

Our 2 main objectives are to

1. Build a live dashboard to track updates in recycling efforts in Singapore using Plotly and Dash. 

2. Design an algorithm to find the shortest path with the lowest carbon footprint for people to recycle their waste products at a recycling bin.
